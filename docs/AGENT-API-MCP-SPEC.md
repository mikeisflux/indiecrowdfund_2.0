# IndieCrowdfund Agent API — MCP integration spec

This document is the hand-off for the MCP server that runs on the NAS next to the
Shopify/eBay one. It describes the HTTP API IndieCrowdfund exposes for agents and
exactly how to wrap it as MCP tools, so the IndieCrowdfund tools can live in the same
server process and show up in Claude alongside the `shopify_*` and `ebay_*` tools.

Nothing in the MCP server needs database access, SSH, or any knowledge of the
IndieCrowdfund codebase. It is a thin client over one authenticated HTTPS API.

```
Claude ──MCP──▶ NAS MCP server ──HTTPS + API key──▶ https://indiecrowdfund.com/api/agent/v1/...
                 (shopify_* tools)                   (tool registry inside the Next.js app)
                 (ebay_* tools)
                 (icf_* tools)   ◀── this spec
```

## 1. Credentials

Issue a key at **Admin → System → Agent API** (`/admin/agent-api`, SUPER_ADMIN only).
It produces two values, shown once:

| Env var | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ICF_API_URL` | `https://indiecrowdfund.com` | Base URL. No trailing slash. |
| `ICF_API_KEY` | `ick_live_…` | Public identifier. |
| `ICF_API_SECRET` | `icsk_live_…` | Proves possession. Only its hash is stored server-side. |

Send both on every request, in headers (never in the URL):

```
X-API-Key: <ICF_API_KEY>
X-API-Secret: <ICF_API_SECRET>
```

`Authorization: Bearer <key>:<secret>` is accepted as an alternative.

**Scopes.** A key has `agent:read` (every reporting/lookup tool) and optionally
`agent:write` (the four guarded mutations). Write implies read. The admin page
shows which a key has. If the MCP server gets a `403 insufficient_scope`, the key
was issued read-only.

**Rotation.** Revoke in the admin page, issue a new one, update the env, restart
the MCP server. Revoked keys return `401` immediately. Their call history is kept.

## 2. Endpoints

All responses are JSON. All timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC. Money is a plain number
of dollars (`93.00` → `93`), never cents.

### `GET /api/agent/v1` — identity check

Use this on startup to fail fast on bad credentials.

```json
{ "ok": true, "version": "1.0", "key": { "name": "NAS MCP server", "scopes": ["agent:read"] }, "tools": 24, "catalog": "/api/agent/v1/tools" }
```

### `GET /api/agent/v1/tools` — tool catalog

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "list_projects",
      "description": "List campaigns with live funding stats. …",
      "scope": "agent:read",
      "mutating": false,
      "inputSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": { … }, "required": [ … ], "additionalProperties": false }
    }
  ]
}
```

`inputSchema` is JSON Schema (draft-07) generated from the server's own validation
schema, so it is always exactly what the server will accept. Fields with a
`default` are optional; the server fills them in. **This endpoint is the source of
truth.** Fetch it at startup and register one MCP tool per entry; tools added to
IndieCrowdfund later appear without a code change on the NAS.

### `POST /api/agent/v1/tools/{name}` — run a tool

Body: a JSON object of the tool's arguments (or empty for tools with none).
`Content-Type: application/json`.

Success:

```json
{ "ok": true, "tool": "get_project", "result": { … } }
```

Failure:

```json
{ "ok": false, "tool": "get_project", "error": { "code": "not_found", "message": "No project matches \"the-ghost-dnace\"." } }
```

| HTTP | `error.code` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_json` | Body wasn't a JSON object. |
| 400 | `invalid_arguments` | Schema validation failed. `error.details` is `[{ path, message }]`. |
| 400 | `confirmation_required` | A mutating tool was called without `confirm: true`. |
| 400 | *(tool-specific)* | The tool refused, e.g. extending a CANCELLED campaign. The message is safe to show the user. |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Bad or revoked credentials. |
| 403 | `insufficient_scope` | Tool needs `agent:write`; key only has `agent:read`. |
| 404 | `unknown_tool` / `not_found` | No such tool, or the project/user wasn't found. |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | Over 120 calls/minute for this key. Back off until `X-RateLimit-Reset` (unix seconds). |
| 500 | `tool_error` | Server-side failure; already logged in Sentinel. Retry once, then surface. |

Every call, successful or not, is written to the Agent API call log that admins
see in `/admin/agent-api`: key, tool, arguments (anything named like a secret is
redacted), outcome, duration, and response size.

**Timeouts.** Tools return within a few seconds; `project_backers` with
`limit: 1000` and `search_logs` can take up to ~10 s. Use a 60 s client timeout.

## 3. The tools

Prefix every tool `icf_` on the MCP side (`icf_list_projects`) so they sort
together and cannot collide with Shopify/eBay names.

`*` = required. Everything else has the default shown or is optional.

### Reading campaigns

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `platform_overview` | — | Campaign counts by status, raised/pledges/backers all-time and last 30 days, new accounts, top categories. |

### Guarded writes — `agent:write` scope, `confirm: true` required

| Tool | Arguments | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `extend_campaign` | `project*`, `days*` (1–90), `confirm*` | Moves a LIVE/FUNDED campaign's end date out. Refuses FAILED/CANCELLED. |

| `add_newsletter_subscribers` | `emails*` (≤500), `tags`, `source`="agent", `confirm*` | Adds/re-activates newsletter subscribers. Blocklisted and opted-out addresses are skipped and listed in the result. |
| `create_email_campaign_draft` | `name*`, `subject*`, `html*`, `targetAudience`="all", `confirm*` | Creates a DRAFT in Admin → Email. Never sends. |

There are deliberately **no** tools that refund, charge, pay out, edit a pledge,
or send email. Those stay behind the admin UI.

## 4. Wrapping it in the MCP server

### Recommended: register tools dynamically from the catalog

At startup, call `GET /api/agent/v1/tools` and add one MCP tool per entry. With
the low-level `Server` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` this is a merge into the
existing `ListTools` / `CallTool` handlers:

```ts
// icf.ts — IndieCrowdfund tools for the NAS MCP server
import type { Tool } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js";

const BASE = process.env.ICF_API_URL!;
const HEADERS = {
  "X-API-Key": process.env.ICF_API_KEY!,
  "X-API-Secret": process.env.ICF_API_SECRET!,
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};
const PREFIX = "icf_";

interface CatalogEntry {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  scope: string;
  mutating: boolean;
  inputSchema: Record<string, unknown>;
}

let catalog: CatalogEntry[] = [];

export async function loadIcfCatalog(): Promise<void> {
  const res = await fetch(`${BASE}/api/agent/v1/tools`, { headers: HEADERS });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`IndieCrowdfund catalog failed: ${res.status} ${await res.text()}`);
  catalog = (await res.json()).tools;
}

/** Entries for the ListTools response, merged with the Shopify/eBay ones. */
export function icfTools(): Tool[] {
  return catalog.map((t) => ({
    name: PREFIX + t.name,
    description: t.mutating
      ? `${t.description}\n\nTHIS CHANGES DATA. Ask the user to approve the exact change first, then call with confirm: true.`
      : t.description,
    inputSchema: t.inputSchema as Tool["inputSchema"],
  }));
}

export function isIcfTool(name: string): boolean {
  return name.startsWith(PREFIX) && catalog.some((t) => PREFIX + t.name === name);
}

/** CallTool handler body. Returns MCP content; errors become isError results. */
export async function callIcfTool(name: string, args: unknown) {
  const tool = name.slice(PREFIX.length);
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const timer = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 60_000);
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${BASE}/api/agent/v1/tools/${encodeURIComponent(tool)}`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: HEADERS,
      body: JSON.stringify(args ?? {}),
      signal: controller.signal,
    });
    const body = await res.json();
    if (!res.ok || body.ok === false) {
      const err = body.error ?? { code: "http_" + res.status, message: res.statusText };
      const details = err.details ? "\n" + err.details.map((d: { path: string; message: string }) => `- ${d.path}: ${d.message}`).join("\n") : "";
      return { isError: true, content: [{ type: "text", text: `IndieCrowdfund ${err.code}: ${err.message}${details}` }] };
    }
    // CSV results come back as a string field; hand it over verbatim.
    const result = body.result;
    const text = result && typeof result.csv === "string"
      ? `total=${result.total}\n${result.csv}`
      : JSON.stringify(result, null, 2);
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text }] };
  } finally {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}
```

Wire-up in the existing server:

```ts
await loadIcfCatalog();   // at startup, after env is loaded; log and continue if it fails

server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => ({
  tools: [...shopifyTools(), ...ebayTools(), ...icfTools()],
}));

server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (req) => {
  const { name, arguments: args } = req.params;
  if (isIcfTool(name)) return callIcfTool(name, args);
  // …existing Shopify / eBay dispatch
});
```

If the server uses the high-level `McpServer.registerTool`, which wants zod
shapes rather than JSON Schema, either convert with `json-schema-to-zod` at
startup or register the IndieCrowdfund tools through the low-level handlers
shown above. The low-level route is simpler and keeps the catalog authoritative.

### Behaviour the wrapper must keep

- **Pass `confirm` through untouched.** The server refuses mutating calls
  without `confirm: true`; the wrapper must not add it on the model's behalf.
  The appended description text tells the model to get the user's approval first.
- **Surface errors as `isError` results, not thrown exceptions**, so the model
  reads the message (which is written for it) and can correct its arguments.
- **Don't cache results.** Everything is live data; the server sets no cache
  headers on purpose.
- **Keep the `icf_` prefix.** Tool names on the server are stable snake_case;
  never rename them on the wrapper side or the call log stops matching.

## 5. Testing from the NAS

```bash
export ICF_API_URL=https://indiecrowdfund.com ICF_API_KEY=ick_live_… ICF_API_SECRET=icsk_live_…

# Credentials and scopes
curl -s "$ICF_API_URL/api/agent/v1" -H "X-API-Key: $ICF_API_KEY" -H "X-API-Secret: $ICF_API_SECRET" | jq

# Catalog (tool names only)
curl -s "$ICF_API_URL/api/agent/v1/tools" -H "X-API-Key: $ICF_API_KEY" -H "X-API-Secret: $ICF_API_SECRET" | jq -r '.tools[].name'

# A read
curl -s "$ICF_API_URL/api/agent/v1/tools/list_projects" -H "X-API-Key: $ICF_API_KEY" -H "X-API-Secret: $ICF_API_SECRET" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"status":["LIVE"],"limit":5}' | jq '.result.projects[] | {slug,raised,backers}'

# A write without confirm → 400 confirmation_required
curl -s "$ICF_API_URL/api/agent/v1/tools/extend_campaign" -H "X-API-Key: $ICF_API_KEY" -H "X-API-Secret: $ICF_API_SECRET" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"project":"the-ghost-dance","days":7}' | jq
```

Every one of these shows up in `/admin/agent-api` under Recent calls.

## 6. Security notes

- Keys are minted only by a SUPER_ADMIN; there is no self-service.
- The secret is hashed at rest; the admin page shows only its prefix.
- Transport is HTTPS only. Credentials go in headers so they never land in
  access logs or Referer headers.
- Rate limit: 120 calls/minute per key, per app worker. Treat `429` as "slow down".
- Call log: every call is recorded with arguments (secret-shaped keys redacted),
  outcome and duration. Admins review it in `/admin/agent-api`.
- What the API never returns: passwords or hashes, card numbers or CVCs (none are
  stored anywhere), bank account numbers, payout details, API keys of any kind,
  survey answers beyond the shipping address (and that only when
  `includeAddress: true`), or anything from soft-deleted accounts.
- PII: backer emails and names are returned by design, because outreach is the
  point. Keep the NAS server's own logs from echoing full results, and don't
  write backer lists to disk outside the task that needed them.

## 7. Change management

- New tools, or new arguments on existing ones, appear in the catalog on deploy.
  The NAS server picks them up on its next restart. No wrapper change needed.
- Renames or removals are breaking and will be announced in the commit message
  and in the admin page's tool list before they land.
- `X-API-Version` / `version` is `1.0`. A `2.0` would mean a new base path
  (`/api/agent/v2`) with `v1` kept alive alongside it.

## Appendix: catalog snapshot

`docs/agent-api-catalog.json` is the exact output of `GET /api/agent/v1/tools`
at the time this spec was written, so the wrapper can be built and unit-tested
offline before a key exists. The live endpoint wins whenever they differ.
